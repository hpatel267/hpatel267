# About Me
After graduating from Purdue University with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2016, I embarked on a six-year journey in the manufacturing industry. Throughout this period, I sharpened my analytical skills and utilized tools such as Excel to drive consistent results and progress in my career. However, it was only recently that I uncovered a profound passion for data analytics. I'm excited to document my journey here as I acquire new skill sets and apply them to meaningful projects!

For this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of all the chess games I have played on Chess.com from 2018 to 2023. My objective was to uncover insights to improve my gameplay, and to illustrate the intricate nature of chess.

I chose to exclusively utilize the programming language R for this analysis. Despite being relatively new to R, I viewed this project as an opportunity to challenge myself and leverage R's robust tools for data analysis and visualization.
